# PHP stack approach

* Frameworks that can be used to build API - Symfony, Laravel (the provided code classes are from Symfony)
* In general we use hexagonal (DDD) approach to structure the code
* We use unit and functional tests to cover code with automated tests that can be run at any time
* We use Composer as a package manager for PHP projects
* Classes are formatted using PSR-2 standard
* Restful API with JSON responses and Swagger API doc generated from the code
